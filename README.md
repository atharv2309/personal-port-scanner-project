# port-scanner-project
Here, I have made a port scanner using Python3. We can use this port scanner to probe a scan the server or host for open ports.
The open ports can then be used by the system administrator to review as security concerns and solve them. These ports can also be used by the hackers to gain access to uncontrolled ports on a system. Then the ports can be used to exploit vulnerabilities and try to get access of the whole website.


My approach and the points that I had in mind while making the port scanner.
1.	We allow our user to specify a target, where we used our variable to accomplish that. 
2.	We make a request to every port on the target with the scripts and the socket that we wrote and the library that we used earlier.
3.	We return every single open port on  the target.
